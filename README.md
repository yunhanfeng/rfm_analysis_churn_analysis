# rfm_analysis_churn_analysis
Data provided by friend in China, I conduct RFM analysis and churn analysis on the members of hotel and mall, which better captures lifetime value of guests 

RFM stands for "Recency, Frequency and Monetary," whcih is widely used in retail, online service and different industries. I extracted the RFM feature from the data set and further used these features for clustering.

I also provided the code for churn analysis here.

The detailed documentation of the walkthrough in analysis and code execution is in my [Medium post](https://medium.com/@henryfeng/rfm-analysis-customer-churn-analysis-for-hotel-mall-enterprise-in-china-d2c6dc794d27).
